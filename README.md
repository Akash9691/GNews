GNews Flutter App Documentation


1. Overview

The GNews Flutter App is a lightweight and scalable news reader application built using Flutter. It integrates with the GNews API to fetch the latest news articles categorized by topics. It supports pagination, detailed views of articles, and a clean UI for both browsing and reading news.

since we are using the api key of Gnews we are using the free api which is giving 100 request per day

if your 100 calls in a day used then use another api key by signing into the GNews dashboard and put the api key in here file called:  appconstants.dart

4. State Management

Why I chose provider:
I chose the Provider package for state management because:

It‚Äôs simple, lightweight, and powerful.

It is officially recommended by the Flutter team.

It has a large community, great documentation, and frequent updates.

It integrates easily with Flutter‚Äôs widget rebuild system.

It supports app-wide state sharing like theme control, authentication, and more.



5. Development Challenges

Problem:
While integrating packages like url_launcher and connectivity_plus, I encountered JDK compatibility errors. The build system (Gradle) failed due to a mismatch between the installed JDK version and what the Flutter/Android tooling expected.

since it is taking lot more time to get the jdk version to download and install i am not able to setup it 
that is why i am not able to add url_launcher and connectivity plus

i have even searched for the alternative of these two packages but all of them using these packages it self soo i am not able to manage that.

solution: I already know the solution of it but because of the time i am not able to do it.
